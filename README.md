# LC-3 Program Simulator

This web application is meant to simulate how an LC-3 program would run by allowing the user to set registers and memory values and then stepping through the program. This project was made by Sameer N. using NodeJS, React, and Redux.

## Run Instructions

To run the client, run the command `npm start` in the client directory. \
To access the application, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser after starting the client.

## Project Features:

-   Writing LC-3 programs directly into the memory and setting registers
-   Debugging LC-3 programs by stepping through them

## Additional Features To Be Added:

-   Implement a data flow diagram for each instruction allowing the user to see how the instruction is processed
